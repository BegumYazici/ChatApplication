# Summary of my project:
- It's a sample chat application which developed Kotlin
- Messages are stored on the Room database(I kept it simple just User and Message table)
- Used MVVM architecture.
- Handled date case it showed date if previous message was sent one hour ago or more.
- Tested message ui model mapper with unit tests
- Used Technologies: MVVM architecture, Room, Coroutine, Junit Testing
- PS: I spent 1.5 days to complete the project

# If I had a more time to complete the project:
- I added dummy users when database is created but Welcome Fragment might be visible before the data inserted in the db so buttons became empty. I would solve the problem if I had more time.
